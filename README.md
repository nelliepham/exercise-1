Reflection

This assignment was pretty tough, especially for a beginner like me. Git was confusing from the very start. Specifically, when the terminal kept asking for a password to push files, even though I thought I had set up everything correctly. I didn't expect that at all because this problem didn't appear in the lecture so I spent hours online trying to figure out what step I had missed. It was quite hard to follow because each tutorial's code outcome was different that I had to compare and find the solution from my own computer. Despite the initial confusion, I did learn the basic Git stuff like making repos, branches, commits, and pull requests. I now understand a little bit about how merging branches works, and how it might be useful for teamwork and planning tasks. However, I still get stuck at some points, especially when things don't go as expected. For example, I struggled with resolving merge conflicts and understanding how to properly use the staging area. I'm not sure if I fully grasped all the concepts, but I'm glad that I finished the assignment, although I'm not entirely sure if it was fully correct or not.Â I hope that with more practice, I can become more proficient in using Git for my future projects.
